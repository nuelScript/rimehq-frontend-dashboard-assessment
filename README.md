# RimeHQ Frontend Dashboard Assessment

A modern, responsive dashboard interface built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, recreating a comprehensive learning management system UI with stunning animations and micro-interactions.

## Approach

I approached this project by breaking down the complex dashboard into modular, reusable components. The layout follows a three-column structure with a collapsible sidebar, main content area, and right sidebar for statistics and mentors. I focused on pixel-perfect recreation of the design, paying attention to colors, spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy. The component architecture emphasizes reusability - cards, mentor lists, and navigation items are all built as flexible components that can be easily extended or modified.

Key design decisions:

- Used CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts
- Implemented stunning animations with Framer Motion for delightful user experience
- Created a consistent color palette matching the original design
- Built modular components for easy maintenance and scalability
- Used placeholder images with descriptive queries for realistic content
- Added micro-interactions and hover effects throughout the interface

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

With more time, I would enhance the following:

- Add proper state management (Redux/Zustand) for sidebar collapse and user interactions
- Implement real chart functionality using libraries like Chart.js or Recharts
- Add proper routing with Next.js App Router for navigation
- Include loading states and skeleton components
- Add comprehensive responsive breakpoints for tablet and mobile
- Implement proper accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Add unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library
- Create a proper design system with consistent spacing and typography scales
- Add real-time data updates and WebSocket connections
- Implement user authentication and authorization

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rimehq-frontend-dashboard-assessment.git
   cd rimehq-frontend-dashboard-assessment
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
